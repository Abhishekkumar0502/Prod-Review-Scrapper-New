samsungs23fe,Khaja Nawas,5,Classy product,"I enjoy this mobile since last 6 months. Camera(especially potrait video), display, sound are so good. More than enough for daily activities. The oneUI and AI photo editing are awesome . I don't regret anymore for not buying Google pixel. But a big drawback is battery. When I use both sim as 5g I have to charge twice within 24 hrs. If I use one sim with preferred network as 4g only , then it lasts a day. Even after oneUI 6.1 update it didn't change."
