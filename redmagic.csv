redmagic,Divya parkash,5,Terrific purchase,"what a beast!it's a gaming phone, so regular people who don't game much might find this device quite a handful. it's a perfect phone, value for money, what more do you want. i accept i was kinda skeptical about the purchase and did watch many review videos and all that crap. it's way more better than those videos show.

redmagic,Shubhodeep Saha,5,Excellent,"It's an amazingly fast and powerful device but it lacks a good camera I feel, the camera app itself lacks a lot of stuffs but this device is for gaming and it does thay perfectly. Tho the aluminum back will feel hot while playing high end games, but that's the normal temperature. Don't worry about it heating up, put on a case you won't even feel it anymore. The phone is super slim despite being so big and it feels sorta slippery without any cover."
